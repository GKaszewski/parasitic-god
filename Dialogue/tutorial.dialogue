Narrator: You are a newborn god, a consciousness adrift in the cosmos.

Narrator: Below you, a nascent world teems with life. A small tribe of followers has begun to worship you. Their belief is your existence.

Narrator: Your goal is simple: nurture this civilization until they can reach for the stars and carry you with them.

Narrator: Grant them miracles to grow their population and advance their industry. Click the buttons on the right to see your powers.

Narrator: But be warned... your divine presence is a paradox. Every miracle that helps your followers also poisons their world, corrupting it.

Narrator: If the world's corruption reaches 100%, it will be consumed, and you along with it.

Narrator: Guide them. Grow them. But do not destroy them before they can escape. Their fate, and yours, is in your hands.
